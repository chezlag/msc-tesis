**How have registered purchases of recipient firms evolved throughout the rollout of e-invoicing?**

E-invoicing enables the real-time tracking of firm transactions. They create a (virtually) complete digital record of issuing firms' sales and a _partial_ record of recipient firms' purchases. As more firms adopt e-invoicing, the recorded data on trading partners' purchases becomes more comprehensive, enhancing the tax authority's ability to identify discrepancies in reported costs. This, in turn, restricts (or enhances) the expected impact of the policy on recipient firms' reported tax liability. The initial step of my analysis is to measure how the share of purchases recorded in e-invoices evolved throughout the policy's rollout. Given my data only covers the first few years of the policy, I anticipate that the coverage of purchases will be limited.

> **H1:** The proportion of purchases recorded in e-invoices by recipient firms will be relatively low during the study period.

**What is the effect of receiving e-invoices on firms' tax compliance?**

In this study I focus on VAT compliance. VAT liability arises from the difference between reported sales and purchases. Firms may lower their tax liability by underreporting sales or overreporting purchases.

As I mentioned, e-invoicing creates a digital record of recipient firms' purchases, which the tax authority could use to verify firm reports. For instance, a new set of non-compliance controls were implemented, which relied heavily on e-invoice data [@canalesUruguayPerfilFactura2018].

The main variable that I expect to be affected by of e-invoice reception, therefore, is **reported purchases**. The impact on purchases depends on firm behaviour at two margins. In the intensive margin, I expect the receipt of e-invoices to reduce (over)reported purchases among firms that were already reporting purchases, as the tax authority exploits new third-party information to verify firms' reports.  In the extensive margin, e-invoices may encourage reporting among firms that were not previously reporting purchases, as the tax authority gains partial visibility of their transactions. 

The overall impact of e-invoicing on reported purchases is theoretically ambiguous, as it depends on the relative magnitude of the intensive and extensive margin effects.  Drawing on evidence from other countries [@fanDynamicEffectsComputerizing2023], I hypothesise that the overall effect will be a reduction in reported purchases, dominated by the intensive margin response. Despite this, based on the implementation of e-invoicing in other countries [@fanDynamicEffectsComputerizing2023] I expect the aggregate effect to be a reduction in reported purchases, with the negative effect on the intensive margin dominating the positive effect on the extensive margin.[^china] For reasons I detail in [Section @sec-results], I will only be able to test my hypotheses regarding the overall effect and the effect on the extensive margin.

Since receiving e-invoices does not provide any new information on firms' sales, I do not expect e-invoice reception to have any effect on (under)reported sales. Consequently, e-invoice reception is expected to increase VAT liability of receiving firms.

[^china]: @fanDynamicEffectsComputerizing2023 evaluate invoice digitisation in China and find that one of the main ways the policy improved compliance was through reduced cost overreporting.

**Are the effects of receiving e-invoices heterogenous across firm characteristics?**

Certain firm characteristics are associated with higher levels of non-compliance. For instance, according to @klevenWhyCanModern2016, larger firms may find it more difficult to avoid compliance without being detected: larger firms keep better records of their activities –which can then be used in an audit– and effective collusion may be more difficult to ensure as more people need to get involved in order to ensure effective non-compliance. On the other hand, compliance tends to worsen in industries closer to end consumers, where te self-enforcing mechanisms of the VAT are much weaker [e.g., @pomeranzNoTaxationInformation2015; @naritomiConsumersTaxAuditors2019; @waseemOverclaimedRefundsUndeclared2023]. Finally, firms with higher use of imported inputs are less exposed to the policy, because imports are not registered in the e-invoicing system. Therefore, they may be less sensitive to the policy when they eventually begin receiving e-invoices.
