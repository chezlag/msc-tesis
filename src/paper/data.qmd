## Data sources and main variables

To study the impact of receiving e-invoices I combine several sources of tax microdata on Uruguayan firms. First, I use information from the e-invoicing system. I have a monthly summary of all inter-firm transactions since the implementation of the system in January 2012 until November 2016. Each row in the dataset summarises the transactions between a pair of companies –issuer and recipient–, recording the number of transactions and the total value of the transactions between them. The data allows me to identify the exact month in which each firm starts issuing and receiving e-invoices.

I combine this information with several tax affidavits levied on firms. From the VAT affidavits, I get my main outcome variables: input VAT, output VAT and net VAT liability, for each firm and year. The CIT and wealth tax affidavits contain information I use to define my analysis sample: annual income, level of assets, industry and CIT filing regime.

Finally, to study heterogeneities by industry I use the Supply and Use Table computed by the Uruguayan Central Bank for 2012. With this data I identify (i) the industries with the highest use of imported inputs and (ii) the industries that most allocate their production to final household consumption. In both categories I define two groups, according to whether they are above or below the median of each metric.

**Treatment.** I define treatment as the first e-invoice receipt. I exploit the variation in the year in which firms begin to be exposed to the policy to estimate the effect of e-invoice receipt on tax compliance. I define the treatment as binary and as an absorbing state. The treatment is binary in that I do not consider different intensities of e-invoice receipt. The treatment is an absorbing state insofar –in the overwhelming majority of cases– once the company receives its first e-invoice, it continues receiving e-invoices every year until the end of the analysis period.

**Outcomes.** I consider three outcome variables that arise from companies' VAT affidavits: VAT purchases, VAT sales and net VAT liability ($= \min{\{\text{VAT sales }-\text{VAT purchases}, 0\}}$). I deflate the variables to 2016 Uruguayan pesos and apply an upper censoring at the 99th percentile to avoid the influence of extreme values. The outcomes are zero-valued for a small but non-trivial percentage of firms, making the selection of their functional form non-innocuous. I follow @chenLogsZerosProblems2023 to get around this problem, explained in more detail in [Section @sec-method].

## Main sample

My main sample is a balanced panel of firms filing VAT under the standard regime (non-simplified, see [Section @sec-context]). They are small firms, i.e., with annual revenues between 305,000 UI and 1,000,00 UI, that file VAT, CIT and wealth tax affidavits every year between 2009-2015. They correspond, roughly speaking, to firms in the first turnover quintile within the non-simplified regime. I use a balanced panel to avoid composition issues due to firms entering or exiting activity. I have incomplete information for tax affidavits filed in 2016, so I use that year's data as a robustness exercise only.

I focus on small firms for two reasons. First, their *potential for evasion*. Several theoretical [@klevenWhyCanModern2016] and empirical studies [@pomeranzNoTaxationInformation2015; @adhikariSmallBusinessTax2021; @bellonDigitalizationImproveTax2022] suggest that small firms evade more than larger firms. The second reason is that it would be desirable for firms not to influence their suppliers' decision to start issuing e-invoices. The small size of the selected firms and their unimportance as individual players (see @fig-small-players in the \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/8dp2z62gf3w5jkf/Online-appendix.pdf?st=lp7mjeeh&dl=0}{Online Appendix}) make it plausible that the exact timing of when firms start receiving e-invoices is (relatively) exogenous.

I impose an additional restriction on the sample: I exclude firms where treatment is not an absorbing state. That is, I exclude firms that receive e-invoices intermittently, with years where they receive e-invoices and years where they do not. They amount to less than 1% of the firms balanced panel, yet including them may blur the interpretation of the estimation results.

There are `1747` firms in the final sample. @tbl-sample-summary presents some summary statistics for the firms. As stated before, the sample is comprised of relatively small firms, which in 2009-2011 reported a median annual turnover of `UYU 853597` and reported, at the median, `UYU 103887` of output VAT and `UYU 44832` of input VAT. `74`% of the companies in the sample received some e-invoice between 2012 and 2016. In contrast, only 1 of them issues e-invoices.

In the final sample, `26`% of the companies reach 2016 without having received any e-invoice. @fig-adoption-inSample presents the cumulative distribution function of first receipt for all firms and for the selected sample. Adoption spreads faster in the sample: at the beginning of 2015 two thirds of the companies in the sample had received at least one e-invoice.
