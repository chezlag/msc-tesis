## Why is there tax evasion?

Tax evasion[^noncomp] is a crucial problem in the design of tax systems, as it affects the cost of collecting taxes and the distribution of the tax burden. It can impact the horizontal and vertical equity of a tax system [@slemrodCheatingOurselvesEconomics2007], and it must be considered when assessing the progressivity and efficiency of any tax design [@slemrodTaxAvoidanceEvasion2002]. Evasion also entails *inefficiencies and costs* that exceed those considered in standard optimal taxation models [@skinnerEconomicPerspectiveTax1985; @pestieauTaxEvasionOccupational1991; @slemrodTaxComplianceEnforcement2019]. Considering avoidance in tax design can change optimal tax policies, including rates, level of progressivity, and tax bases [@slemrodTaxComplianceEnforcement2019; @gordonTaxStructuresDeveloping2009; @bestProductionRevenueEfficiency2015]. It also invites rethinking the design of other facets of taxation ignored in canonical tax models. For example, @slemrodTaxSystems2014 highlight the importance of *remittance rules*, which define which entity is legally responsible for paying taxes to the government. Recent studies have shown that these rules can havThere are a number of papers that analyze the effects of e-invoicing systems on business behaviors. Set in various contexts, they give guidelines of the potential effects of the policy and illustrate interesting aspects of companies' evasive strategies prior to implementation. 

The benchmark evaluation is that of @bellonDigitalizationImproveTax2022, focusing on e-invoice issuance in Peru. They employ a difference-in-differences design with staggered treatment, exploiting variation in mandatory policy adoption dates. They find that firms report 7.4% more sales and 5.5% more purchases in the year after adoption, and that the effects are increasing in the year of adoption. Firms' responses are, however, heterogeneous. The effect is explained primarily by behavioral changes in small and medium-sized firms; and firms in sectors of activity with larger compliance gaps prior to implementation.

The effect on revenue collection is decreasing over time, as companies adjust their production downward in the long run. Despite this, the fall in production does not neutralize the increase in revenue, which increases steadily in the five years following implementation. Overall, the policy would explain 14% of the increase in VAT revenue in China between 1998 and 2007.

The Uruguayan case was analyzed by @bergoloFacturaElectronicaCumplimiento2018 using the same data as this thesis. Like @bellonDigitalizationImproveTax2022 they apply a difference-in-differences design with staggered treatment, taking advantage of the variation in mandatory policy adoption dates. However, unlike the Peru work, the data covers only the adoption of the first cohort of firms, with annual revenues greater than 30 million Indexed Units (IU, approx. 3M USD in 2016). Despite the limited coverage of the data, the authors find that Value Added Tax (VAT) payments and withholdings increase 3.7% in the six months following the e-invoice issuance mandate. 

There are evaluations - of varying comprehensiveness and methodology - that study e-invoicing in Argentina [@artanaAnalisisImpactoFactura2018], Ecuador [@ramirezalvarezFacturaElectronicaEcuador2018], Mexico [@fuentescastroImpactoEvasionPor2016] and South Korea [@leeCanElectronicTax2016]. Other studies evaluate a similar e-invoicing policy-the introduction of electronic sales recording machines-in Rwanda [@eissaIncidenceImpactElectronic2014], Ethiopia [@aliBuildingFiscalCapacity2021] and Hungary [@lovicsEffectIntroductionOnline2019]. All evaluations find similar results: firms that adopt new technology pay more taxes and report more sales revenue.

A major limitation of all the studies reviewed is that they focus on the impact of e-invoice *issuance* and do not analyze the potential effects of e-invoice *reception*. Recent literature highlights the importance of studying spillovers when performing a full evaluation of any intervention [@lopez-luzuriagaComplianceSpilloversTaxes2019]. In this case, studying the receipt of e-invoices brings us closer to the *downstream* spillover of the policy -from the treated companies to their buyers-. E-invoicing policies generate very large volumes of information and the *spillovers* between companies can be considerable. Giving a first approximation to these spillover effects is the main contribution of my thesis.
e important effects on tax incidence and compliance [@slemrodDoesItMatter2008; @dharmapalaTaxPolicyMissing2011; @pomeranzNoTaxationInformation2015]. This whole discussion is especially relevant to the design of tax systems in developing countries, in that evasion can limit the development of state capacities and constrain economic performance [@burgessTaxationDevelopment1993; @besleyTaxationDevelopment2013].

[^noncomp]: In the text I use tax evasion and noncompliance interchangeably. Strictly speaking non-compliance also encompasses avoidance –the legal alternatives for paying less taxes–. In practice the line between evasion and avoidance may sometimes be blurry.

In the canonical model of tax evasion, taxpayers' actions are determined by the private costs and benefits of evasion. The seminal formulation of @allinghamIncomeTaxEvasion1972 –an adaptation of @beckerCrimePunishmentEconomic1968's model of crime deterrence– focuses on noncompliance of an income tax. In the model the taxpayer decides how much income to report to the tax authority by seeking a balance between the private benefits of evading and its costs. Then, the decision to evade or not to evade depends on individual risk aversion and the institutional context of the decision, which defines the tax rate, the probability of detection and the penalties for noncompliance.

The model predicts evasion will occur if the expected payout of evading is positive, and that increases in fines or detection probability reduce noncompliance. The tax rate's impact on evasion depends on how the fine is calculated. In the original formulation of the model the fine is proportional to the *income* evaded; in this context, an increase in the tax rate increases the gains from evasion but not the fine, making non-compliance more attractive. @yitzhakiNoteIncomeTax1974 notes that if the penalty depends on the *tax* evaded –as it does in several countries– then the tax rate affects in equal proportion the gains and costs of evading, so changes in the rate would not impact the amount evaded.

The main problem with the canonical model appears when contrasting its predictions with empirical estimations of evasion. For example, despite the low audit rates and low non-compliance penalties prevalent in most developed countries, observed levels of evasion consistently fall below those predicted by models such as that of @allinghamIncomeTaxEvasion1972. proposed various explanations to account for this discrepancy. One line of research highlights the model's failure to consider non-pecuniary factors that heavily influence taxpayers' evasion decision. These factors include social norms, patriotism, “tax morale”, and psychological factors such as guilt and shame [see review by @luttmerTaxMorale2014]. Another line of research emphasises the *informational context* of evasion decisions, highlighting the role of third-party information reporting, activity documentation, and whistleblowing in ensuring tax compliance [@klevenUnwillingUnableCheat2011;@pomeranzNoTaxationInformation2015; @klevenWhyCanModern2016; @naritomiConsumersTaxAuditors2019; @kumlerEnlistingEmployeesImproving2020]. When examining the drivers of corporate action –as in this thesis– informational context may play a more significant role than tax morale [@slemrodTaxComplianceEnforcement2019].

## Evasion and information

### Evasion models with third party reported information.

@klevenUnwillingUnableCheat2011 incorporate third-party information into a personal income tax evasion model, distinguishing between two types of income: third-party reported income and self-reported income. The tax authority has information on income reported by third parties, creating a near-certain probability of detection if a taxpayer under-reports these types of income. This would be the case, for example, of under-reporting labour income documented through employer payroll systems, which in many countries is submitted directly to the tax authority. In contrast, self-reported income, such as earnings from self-employment, can only be verified through audits. The model predicts that taxpayers will accurately report third-party-reported income while heavily evading self-reported income. When testing this model in Denmark, the authors find strong evidence supporting their predictions. The overall evasion rate is low (2.2%) but masks significant heterogeneities: evasion rates for third-party reported income are 1.1%, while those for self-reported income reach 14.6%.

@carrilloDodgingTaxmanFirm2017 extend @klevenUnwillingUnableCheat2011's framework to examine tax evasion in corporate income tax. In this extension, firms report revenues and costs to the tax authority, and pay taxes on their profits (i.e. on the difference between revenues and costs). The tax authority obtains partial information on a firm's costs and revenues via third-party reporting. If a firm reports lower revenues or costs than those recorded by third parties, it faces an audit with near certainty. The model predicts that firms will report revenues equal to those reported by third parties, but the same is not necessarily true for costs. It thus highlights a key asymmetry in corporate tax reporting: third-party-reported costs act as a lower bound for reported costs, but firms can reduce their tax liability by over-reporting additional costs. And unless the tax authority can fully verify costs, distinguishing legitimate from inflated expenses requires an audit. When testing their model in Ecuador, the authors find that when the tax authority notifies firms of discrepancies between their reported revenue and third-party reports, firms correct their affidavits to exactly match third-party reported revenue. However, firms also upwardly adjust their reported costs –which the tax authority has no means of verifying– in order to reduce their tax liability.

The models developed by @klevenUnwillingUnableCheat2011 and @carrilloDodgingTaxmanFirm2017 highlight key aspects of tax avoidance. Both emphasise the crucial role of third-party information in ensuring accurate reporting. In its absence, taxpayer behaviour aligns closely with predictions from the @allinghamIncomeTaxEvasion1972 model. However, these models also point towards the limitations of third-party reports when their coverage is incomplete, especially when taxpayers or firms can exploit multiple adjustment margins to minimise their tax liabilities.

### The importance of who pays taxes and the role of firms in tax collection

@slemrodDoesItMatter2008 argues that tax remittance rules play a crucial role in evaluating a tax system when there is tax evasion. On the administrative side, the costs of a given tax structure depend significantly on who handles tax payments. For instance, the fewer taxpayers the tax authority has to monitor, the less costly a system is. Additionally, remittance rules shape evasion opportunities and monitoring technologies, potentially influencing the supply and demand for taxed activities. Put another way, they can influence relative prices of different productive activities, which has implications for the overall effect of the tax system on efficiency.

Firms are central agents in tax collection, often responsible for remitting a substantial share of taxes to the government.[^firm-remittance] By consolidating information from numerous transactions, firms reduce the number of individual taxpayers the tax authority needs to monitor in order to ensure compliance [@kopczukPuttingFirmsOptimal2006]. Many tax systems require firms to report information on transactions that involve their business partners, and to act as withholding agents for other taxpayers –whether employees or business partners=, two ways in which they further assist with aggregate tax compliance  [@slemrodDoesItMatter2008].

Firms can also bolster tax compliance in ways beyond remittance. For instance, @klevenWhyCanModern2016 link high levels of tax compliance in developed countries to the complexity of firms' operations. Their model connects business complexity with a greater need for detailed internal records and larger workforces. This combination—extensive records that can provide evidence of irregularities and more employees who might report them— creates strong incentives for larger firms to comply with their tax obligations.

[^firm-remittance]: Studies for the UK [@shawAdministrationCompliance2010], US [@christensenTotalCorporateTaxation2001] and a set of OECD countries [@milanezLegalTaxLiability2017] estimated that between 80-90% of tax collection was realized through companies. One of the first estimates for a developing country - India - arrived at a figure in the same range, despite having a very different tax structure than developed countries [@slemrodFirmsRemitLeast2017].

## Evasion of the Value Added Tax

In this paper I focus on Value Added Tax (VAT) evasion. I will now provide an brief overview of the main features of VAT and the forms of evasion associated with it, drawing on the works of @keenVATFraudEvasion2006, @keenVATAttacks2007, and @slemrodVAT100Retrospective2022, as well as @jamesRiseValueaddedTax2015's comprehensive analysis of VAT's global adoption.
The most common version of the VAT operates as a broad-based consumption tax applied at a single rate using a credit deduction system and adhering to the destination principle of production. Under this framework, businesses pay a flat rate on their value added, defined as the difference between their domestic sales and purchases from other firms. Through the credit deduction system, businesses remit VAT on their total sales while claiming credits for the VAT paid on their purchases. Sales are subject to the VAT of the jurisdiction in which they are consumed: exports are zero-rated, enabling exporters to claim refunds for VAT paid on inputs, while imports are taxed at the same rate as domestic goods. In practice, many countries diverge from this standard model by introducing exemptions for specific goods or industries, or by imposing additional taxes on particular types of consumption.

Taxpayers can evade VAT in many ways, some of which are common to most consumption taxes. Firms may under-report sales, fail to register with tax authorities, or misclassify sales under lower tax rates to reduce liabilities. VAT-specific forms of evasion arise from the credit deduction system. Firms may fraudulently inflate costs by reporting fictitious purchases or claiming personal expenses as business-related deductions. Some may create fraudulent entities—so-called "invoice mills"—designed solely to generate false invoices and claim credits for non-existent costs. Despite their significance, certain forms of VAT evasion remain under-researched in the literature.

This thesis only examines two forms of VAT evasion: sales under-reporting and cost over-reporting. Additionally, it includes a general measure of noncompliance derived from changes in VAT liabilities. The available data do not allow me to distinguish between the specific methods of noncompliance outlined above. In [Section @sec-hypotheses] I detail how I expect e-invoicing to impact tax non-compliance.

## New technologies in tax administration
My thesis is broadly linked to a growing body of research regarding the introduction of technologies in the public sector and their role in enhancing state capacity in developing countries [@guptaDigitalRevolutionsPublic2017].  For example, @lewis-faupelCanElectronicProcurement2016 find that digitisation of public procurement (*e-procurement*) in India and Indonesia improves the quality of public works and reduces delays. @muralidharanBuildingStateCapacity2016 and @banerjeeEgovernanceAccountabilityLeakage2020 show that integrating technologies in the management of public funds can both improve their administration and prevent misappropriations.

More specifically, this thesis focuses on the adoption of new technologies in tax administration. @okunogbeHowCanLowerIncome2024 highlight how investments in technology strengthen the three core functions of tax management: identifying taxpayers, determining tax liabilities, and remitting payments to state coffers. Following @okunogbeBecomingLegibleState2023, these functions are termed identification, detection, and collection.

New technologies can enhance tax administration in several ways. They can improve taxpayer identification –both for individuals and organisations– through creation of detailed, easily maintainable digital records. They can assist in detecting irregularities in tax returns by automating internal checks and integrating third-party reporting. They can also streamline debt collection through electronic financial instruments and simplify the imposition of fines. In short, new technologies have the potential to reduce tax non-compliance by strengthening the State's administrative capacity –regardless of the tax instruments used and their tax rates– by incorporating new inputs and making better use of existing ones, while simultaneously lowering compliance costs.

Empirical studies have provided evidence of the benefits provided by different technologies. For example, @okunogbeTechnologyTaxationCorruption2022 find that electronic tax filing (_e-filing_) in Tajikistan reduced compliance costs for taxpayers and mitigated the effects of corruption on tax collection. More directly relevant to this thesis, the following subsection reviews key studies on e-invoicing systems in various countries.

### Empirical evidence on e-invoicing

Several studies examine the effects of e-invoicing systems on business behaviours, offering insights into the potential impacts of these policies and illustrating firms' evasion strategies prior to implementation.

@bellonDigitalizationImproveTax2022 provide a benchmark evaluation of e-invoice issuance for the Peruvian case. Using a staggered difference-in-differences design, they exploit variation in the mandatory adoption dates of the policy. The authors find that firms report 7.4% more sales and 5.5% more purchases in the year following adoption, with the effects increasing after the first year of issuing e-invoices. Small and medium-sized firms, as well as those in industries with larger pre-implementation compliance gaps, primarily drive these results.

In China, @fanDynamicEffectsComputerizing2023 study the introduction of e-invoices in the manufacturing sector. The nationwide rollout in 2001 enables them to explore the policy's long-term effects on tax compliance and firms' economic activities. Given the policy was implemented simultaneously across the country, they use the variation in firms' exposure to the policy to identify its effects. 

Their findings show that firms increased VAT payments after implementation, a result mainly driven by reduced cost overreporting. While the policy boosts revenue collection initially, its impact diminishes over time as firms downwardly adjust their production in the long run. Nonetheless, increased compliance overweighed real production adjustments, with overall VAT revenues increasing steadily in the five years following implementation. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that e-invoicing could have accounted for 14% of the rise in China's VAT revenue between 1998 and 2007.

@bergoloFacturaElectronicaCumplimiento2018 analyse e-invoicing in Uruguay using the same dataset employed in this thesis. Like @bellonDigitalizationImproveTax2022, they apply a difference-in-differences design with staggered treatment, leveraging variation in mandatory adoption dates. However, their study focuses only on the first cohort of adopters –firms with annual revenues exceeding 30 million Indexed Units (approximately USD 3 million in 2016)–. Despite this limitation, their results show a 3.7% increase in affected firms' VAT payments within six months of being mandated into issuing e-invoices

Additional evaluations, employing diverse methodologies and of varying coprehensiveness, explore e-invoicing in Argentina [@artanaAnalisisImpactoFactura2018], Ecuador [@ramirezalvarezFacturaElectronicaEcuador2018], Mexico [@fuentescastroImpactoEvasionPor2016], and South Korea [@leeCanElectronicTax2016]. Studies of related policies, such as electronic sales recording machines, in Rwanda [@eissaIncidenceImpactElectronic2014], Ethiopia [@aliBuildingFiscalCapacity2021], and Hungary [@lovicsEffectIntroductionOnline2019], also yield consistent findings: firms adopting these technologies report higher revenues and increase tax payments.

A major limitation of the reviewed studies lies in their exclusive focus on the effects of e-invoice _issuance_. They neglect the potential impact of e-invoice _reception_, which may drive important spillover effects. Recent literature emphasises the necessity of accounting for spillovers in order to provide comprehensive policy evaluations [@lopez-luzuriagaComplianceSpilloversTaxes2019]. Examining e-invoice reception approximates the _downstream_ spillovers of the policy, tracing its effects from issuing firms to their buyers. Since e-invoicing generates vast volumes of inter-firm data, these spillovers could be substantial. Estimating these effects constitutes the primary contribution of this thesis.
