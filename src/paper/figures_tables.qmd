> \scriptsize \textbf{Notes:} The figure shows the cdf of the dates when firms first issue e-invoices (panel a), the percentage of production traded with e-invoices by industry (panel b) and a histogram of the dates when firms in the sample first received e-invoices (panel c). In the first two panels, I consider the universe of firms in the DGI microdata; in the third panel I include only the firms in the main sample (see [Section @sec-data]). In panel (b) three industries are highlighted for illustrative purposes, and the other industries are plotted anonymously.

> \scriptsize \textbf{Notas:} This table presents descriptive statistics of the variables relevant to the analysis for the firms in the sample prior to the start of e-invoicing implementation. Column 2 presents the same information for all firms, excluding those under simplified reporting regimes (see [Section @sec-context]). Monetary variables are expressed in constant 2016 UYU.

> \scriptsize \textbf{Notes:} The figure shows the share of input VAT reported by firms that is recorded on e-invoices each year. A boxplot is presented by year, with the median and the interquartile range.

::: {#fig-time-trends}

![](../../out/figures/time_trends.png)

> \scriptsize \textbf{Notes:} The figure shows the average results for the main tax compliance outcomes, by year and by treatment cohort. Dots indicate the start of treatment for each cohort and the dashed portion of each line indicates the period in which firms in the cohort received e-invoices. All results are expressed in deflated 2016 UYU and the y-axis is in logs. The purple line -Inf- corresponds to the group that never received an e-invoice in the analysis period.

Annual average of main tax compliance outcomes by treatment cohort.

::: {#fig-twfe-es}

![](../../out/figures/Slides_1.png)

> \scriptsize \textbf{Notes:} The figure shows the estimated effect of receiving e-invoices on input VAT, output VAT and net VAT liability, expressed in log-points. The effects are estimated following the @eq-es and correspond to the average treatment effect $l$ periods after the start of treatment, for all firms that received e-invoices for at least $l$ periods. The sample consists of a balanced panel of firms in the main analysis sample, with outcomes censored at the 99th percentile. Bands correspond to simultaneous confidence intervals and standard errors are clustered by firm.

> \scriptsize \textbf{Notes:} This table documents the robustness of the main DD specification presented in [Section @sec-method]. The table shows the DD $\beta$ estimate of the @eq-twfe equation for each outcome. Columns 1, 4 and 7 reproduce the preferred speciﬁcation (as shown in the @fig-twfe-es). Columns 2, 5 and 8 show the robustness of the results with a more conservative upper censoring (winsorizing at p95). Finally, columns 3, 7 and 9 show the robustness of the results to an extended sample including observations for the year 2016. This table is discussed in [Section @sec-results-effect].

> \scriptsize \textbf{Notes:} This table documents the robustness of the main DD specification at the extensive margin and is discussed in [Section @sec-method]. The table shows the DD $\beta$ estimate of the @eq-twfe equation for the probability that the outcome variables are greater than zero. Columns 1, 4 and 7 reproduce the preferred specification. Columns 2, 5 and 8 show the robustness of the results with a more conservative upper censoring (*winsorizing* on p95). Finally, columns 3, 7 and 9 show the robustness of the results to an extended sample including observations for the year 2016.
