## Characterization of e-invoice reception {#sec-results-rollout}

First, I will characterise the receipt of e-invoices, its evolution and its intensity. Understanding how much of firms' purchases are recorded in e-invoices may point to the magnitude of the spillovers that can be expected from the policy.

E-invoicing started out with a few large companies in 2012. Reception spread rapidly at the extensive margin: by the end of 2013 half of the firms in my sample had received an e-invoice (@fig-adoption-inSample). In the years that followed, the number of issuing companies, the number of vouchers issued and the volume of transactions recorded on e-invoices grew exponentially. Naturally, the number of recipient firms and the share of their purchases that were recorded on e-invoices also increased.

@fig-reception-intensity presents a boxplot of the share of input VAT that was recorded on e-invoices, for each of the years since the system was implemented. There was a steady increase in purchase coverage over time: e-invoices covered 1% of reported input VAT of the median e-invoice recipient in 2012, and 27% of reported input VAT in 2016. There is significant variation across firms: in 2016, the interquartile range of input VAT coverage was 14%-56%.

The evolution of e-invoice reception was not uniform across firms. Firms that reported higher revenues before the policy receive e-invoices earlier (@fig-takeup-by, panel (a)). Firms in the top three quantiles of reported revenue behave very similarly: more than 75% of these firms had received e-invoices by 2013 and by the end of the period almost all had done so. Firms in the first quintile –roughly my analysis sample– behave very differently. Although reception evolves in parallel with the higher turnover quintiles, the level is substantially lower. In contrast, reception at the intensive margin does not show significant differences between quintiles (@fig-reception-intensity-by, panel (a)). In other words, although receipt was heterogeneously spread, the proportion of VAT purchases recorded on e-invoices was similar for all receiving firms across the distribution.

Reception of e-invoices was also heterogeneous across industries.
Manufacturing and retail were the industries where reception was more widespread, faster and more sustained (@fig-takeup-by, panel (b)). By the end of 2013, 75% of firms in these industries had received an e-invoice and by the end of 2016 virtually all firms in the sector had. Reception spread far more slowly within firms in the service industry and agriculture. Reception intensity, on the other hand, was only moderately heterogeneous across industries (@fig-reception-intensity-by, panel (b)). Input VAT reports were most registered in e-invoices in the non-business services industry: the interquartile range of input VAT coverage for this industry was 14%-54% in 2015. In contrast, in agriculture and manufacturing the interquartile range of coverage in 2015 was 8%-41%.

In sum, in [Section @sec-hypotheses] I posited that (H1) I did not expect e-invoicing to register a high share of recipient firms' purchases during the period under analysis. At that time there were a very small number of companies issuing vouchers, and it stands to reason that the coverage of purchases at the individual company level would have been small. It is interesting, however, to see the swiftness with which e-invoice reception spread at the extensive margin. It would appear that the first e-invoice issuers, in addition to having high levels of invoicing, were suppliers of a substantial share of firms in the Uruguayan economy.

## Effect on tax compliance {#sec-results-effect}

To study the impact of receiving e-invoices on firms' tax compliance, I follow the methodology outlined in [Section @sec-method]. I exploit the variation in the date when firms first receive an e-invoice using a difference-in-differences strategy to quantify the impact of e-invoice receipt on input VAT, output VAT and net VAT liability reports.

Average outcomes differ across treatment cohorts (@fig-time-trends). The first firms to receive e-invoices report more sales, more purchases and owe more VAT in absolute terms. This does not pose a problem, however, because the key assumption of the difference-in-differences (DD) method is that of parallel trends –in this context, that the outcomes of firms receiving their first e-invoice in different years would have evolved in parallel to those of firms that did not adopt e-invoices in subsequent years–.

A visual inspection of @fig-time-trends reveals that, on average, the outcomes of the different treatment cohorts evolve in parallel, with the exception of the group of firms that did not receive any e-invoices during the analysis period. This group exhibits progressively declining activity over the years and displays divergent trends from the other cohorts across all the variables analysed.

To formalise the visual inspection, I plot the coefficients from the event study specification in @eq-es, shown in @fig-twfe-es, estimating a separate regression for each outcome variable. Each coefficient represents the average treatment effect $l$ periods after beginning treatment, for all firms that had been receiving e-invoices for at least $l$ periods. Coefficients are normalised to the $l=-1$ event and are presented with 95% confidence intervals. None of the pre-treatment coefficients are statistically significant. While this does not definitively validate the identification assumption, it does provide evidence supporting the chosen research design. On the other hand, post-treatment coefficients oscillate noisily around zero, showing no clearly discernible dynamics.

The main results of the analysis are presented in @tbl-twfe-all. Columns 1, 4 and 7 show the estimated impact of receiving e-invoices with the preferred specification, using a balanced panel of firms with outcome variables censored at the 99th percentile. I find positive point estimates for all outcome variables, but they are statistically indistinguishable from zero. The estimated effect on input VAT is `0.074` (SE = `0.061`), on output VAT is `0.044` (SE = `0.049`) and on net VAT liability is `0.093` (SE = `0.089`).

In [Section @sec-hypotheses] I proposed that receiving e-invoices would have (H2) a negative effect on VAT purchases, (H3) no effect on VAT sales, and (H4) a positive effect on VAT due. However the results do not allow me to confirm or reject these hypotheses. Although the point estimates are positive, given they are not statistically distinguishable from zero, I cannot confirm anything about their magnitude or sign.

In @tbl-twfe-ext, I explicitly test for changes in the extensive margin by dichotomising the dependent variables. I find that receiving e-invoices is associated with a `1.6%` increase in the probability of reporting input VAT and a `1.2%` increase in the probability of reporting output VAT, both statistically significant at 1%. I find no effect on the probability of owing VAT. These results suggest that the receipt of e-invoices led some firms at the margin to make more complete declarations of their activity to the tax authority, even at this preliminary stage of implementation. The positive effect on the extensive margin of reporting input VAT is in line with the expected outcome proposed in (H2a).

On the other hand, the effect on the extensive margin of output VAT reporting puts into question (H3) the absence of effect on reported sales. While I cannot rule out that the total effect on sales is null, the result suggests that receiving e-invoices may influence the reporting of items on which the policy itself does not provide new information.

Hypothesis (H2b) posited that the effect of receiving e-invoices on the intensive margin of reported purchases would be negative and, in addition, that the positive effect on the extensive margin would dominate. To test this hypothesis, I would have to re-estimate considering only firms that report positive purchases. However, as I noted in [Section @sec-hypotheses], the data does not allow me to test for this effect. Using the unbalanced panel of firms reporting positive purchases introduces significant compositional effects, making the coefficients difficult to interpret. Conversely, restricting my analysis to the balanced panel leaves too few observations, calling into question the external validity of the analysis. Consequently, I cannot credibly test hypothesis (H2b) with the current design and available data.

In the following subsection I propose several robustness exercises to confirm my analysis.

### Robustness {#sec-results-effect-robust}

**Outliers and medium term.** As a first robustness test, I re-estimate everything by censoring the outcome variables at the 95th percentile (@tbl-twfe-all, columns 2, 5 and 8). By applying a more conservative censoring of the outcomes I seek to test the sensitivity of the estimation to outliers. Second, I include partial information from 2016 in the sample (@tbl-twfe-all, columns 3, 6 and 9). Although the 2016 data are incomplete, [^inc16] I include these data points to test whether the aggregate effect differs over the medium term, as the policy gained more traction. In both specifications, the estimated effects are virtually indistinguishable from those found with the preferred specification. 

[^inc16]: In my sample, I only have information for about one-third of the firms in 2016. Balancing the sample for 2009-2016 would imply retaining a very small number of firms.

**Extensive margin.** As a third robustness test, in @tbl-twfe-cr23 I present the results of the preferred specification while varying the value imputed to extensive margin changes, following @chenLogsZerosProblems2023. In my preferred specification I had assigned the extensive margin $\varepsilon$ a value of 10%. I re-estimate with $\varepsilon=$ 0% (columns 2, 6 and 10), $\varepsilon=$ 20% (columns 3, 7 and 11) and $\varepsilon=$ 300% (columns 4, 8 and 12). In no case do the estimated effects become significant, but they do increase in magnitude when I give more weight to the extensive margin. The fact that in I do not find a statistically significant aggregate effect –even when assigning the extreme value $\varepsilon=$ 300%– suggests that the effects at the intensive margin overweigh those found at the intensive margin.

**Callaway & Sant'Anna (2021).** In @sec-appendix-cs21 (in the \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/8dp2z62gf3w5jkf/Online-appendix.pdf?st=lp7mjeeh&dl=0}{Online Appendix}) I re-run all estimations applying the methodology proposed by @callawayDifferenceinDifferencesMultipleTime2021. As I mentioned in [Section @sec-method], their method has the advantage of allowing for arbitrary heterogeneities in the treatment effect over time and across treatment cohorts. Results hold in this alternative strategy, even when the signs of some point-estimates change: I do not find a statistically significant effect in any of the outcomes analysed.

**Instrumental variables** In my last robustness exercise I try a different strategy. I exploit cross-industry linkages to compute the probability that a firm receives an e-invoice in a given year and use it to instrument for e-invoice receipt. This methodology has the advantage of allowing me to use all firms in the panel. I detail the strategy and present results in @sec-appendix-iv (in the \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/8dp2z62gf3w5jkf/Online-appendix.pdf?st=lp7mjeeh&dl=0}{Online Appendix}). In my preferred specification I find that a 10% increase in the amount of input VAT registered in e-invoices leads to a 0.3% reduction in firms' reported input VAT. I find no effects on net VAT liabilities nor output VAT. The effects are in line with hypotheses (H2) and (H3), although I do not find effects on VAT liabilities as suggested in (H4). The magnitude of the effect on input VAT reports, however, is very small, which provides further evidence that the effect may be undetectable with the main difference-in-differences strategy.

### Heterogeneities {#sec-results-effect-het}

In the last part of my analysis, I explore possible heterogeneous effects of the policy, considering firm size, the share of output going to household final consumption, and the use of imported inputs. The estimation strategy follows the methodology described in @eq-twfe-het.

**Firm size.** @tbl-twfe-het-size presents the results of estimating the @eq-twfe-het, allowing the policy to have a differential impact according to firm size. As I mentioned in [Section @sec-hypotheses], this analysis is motivated by recent studies that find that a firm's size is linked to its tax compliance [@klevenWhyCanModern2016; @adhikariSmallBusinessTax2021]. I separate the effect into two subsamples according to whether the firm's average asset level in 2009-2011 was above or below the median level. There are no significant effects of the policy on VAT purchases or VAT sales, but there are significant effects on VAT owed by larger firms in the sample. However, the suggested magnitude of this impact (30%) should be interpreted with caution. The sample analyzed corresponds to companies in the first turnover quintile, so the comparison is between small and very small companies. Large companies are excluded from this analysis. The preferred specification is presented in columns 1, 4 and 7. Robustness exercises in the remaining columns do not substantially alter the results.

**Household final consumption.** The VAT's self-reinforcing mechanisms disappear at the final consumption stage [@keenVATFraudEvasion2006]. Sectors of activity closer to this stage are more likely to evade, and thus to respond more significantly to the policy. To analyze this, I allow the effect of the policy to differ according to the proportion of each industry's output going to final production. Industries with high exposure are defined as those where the share is higher than the median. [^industry-consumption] @tbl-twfe-het-industry presents the results. No significant effects are found for any of the outcome variables, as shown in columns 1, 4 and 7, and confirmed by robustness exercises in the other columns.

[^industry-consumption]: I identify the final consumption exposure at the industry level because I do not have this information at the firm level. I use the 2012 Supply and Use Table computed by the Uruguayan Central Bank. @tbl-industry-summary (col. 1) presents the share of industries' final production destined to final consumption.

**Imports.** Firms that import a higher share of their inputs have a lower probability of being affected by the policy, since imports are not exchanged using e-invoices. I analyse differential effects of the policy according to whether firms operate in an industry whose share of imported inputs exceeds that of the median industry.[^industry-imports] Results are presented in @tbl-twfe-het-imports. Once again, there are no statistically significant effects on any of the variables analysed, in any of the specifications tested.

[^industry-imports]: Since I am unable to identify how many imports each firm makes, I again resort to industry imports. @tbl-industry-summary (col. 2) presents the proportion of each sector's inputs that is imported.
