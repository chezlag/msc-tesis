## Corporate taxes in Uruguay

Uruguayan firms are subject to a corporate income tax (CIT) and a value added tax (VAT), among other levies. The CIT is levied on business income at a rate of 25%. VAT has a basic rate of 22% and a reduced rate of 10% applied to products categorised as basic necessities. In addition to VAT and CIT, there is a corporate Wealth Tax of 1.5% and a number of other taxes specific to certain characteristics of the company and/or its production.[^other-taxes]

[^other-taxes]: The *Impuesto de Control a las Sociedades Anónimas* (ICOSA) is a lump sum tax (around USD 500 in 2016) levied only on limited liability corporations. The *Impuesto a la Enajenación de Bienes Agropecuarios* (IMEBA) is levied on up to 2.5% of the value of sales of small-scale agribusinesses. The *Impuesto Interno Específico* (IMESI) is levied on specific consumption goods at various rates, set by different laws and decrees. Foreign firms are subject to the Non-Resident Income Tax instead of the regular CIT. These firms are not included in this analysis. On the other hand, individuals are subject to Personal Income Tax (IRPF), a dual tax that taxes capital income at fixed rates (IRPF category I) and labor income at progressive rates (IRPF category II).

Small and medium-sized firms follow alternative tax filing regimes. The smallest companies –with annual revenues of less than 305,000 Indexed Units (IU, approx. 35,000 USD in 2016)– are exempt from paying CIT. Furthermore, they pay a fixed monthly amount for VAT that is not dependent on their revenue nor costs (in 2016 it amounted to 100 USD/mo.). Exempt companies are not required to file CIT or VAT affidavits, but they must file an annual declaration of their equity for the payment of the corporate wealth tax.

Small firms with a turnover over 305,000 IU are not exempted from any tax and must file CIT, VAT and wealth tax returns every year. However, they are covered by a preferential CIT. Under the preferential CIT, firms report their annual revenue and a fictitious profit rate is imputed to them. The fictitious profit is then taxed by CIT at 25%. The fictitious profit rate varies by turnover brackets to encourage companies to develop sufficient accounting systems as they increase their production –so they can start filing taxes under the regular CIT–. In practice, the preferential regime operates as a tax on turnover under a progressive rate scheme.[^fict].

[^fict]:  For billings less than 2 million IU, a profit rate of 13.2% is assumed; between 2 and 3 million IU the rate is 36%; and for billings greater than 3 million IU the fictitious rate amounts to 48%. These are equivalent to a turnover tax at rates of 3.3%, 9%, and 12%.    The discontinuity in the rates is pronounced and manages to encourage companies to file real declarations of their activity: only 5% of the companies that file fictitious declarations report a turnover greater than 2 million IU.

Companies not covered by the fictitious regime must report their real profit in the IRAE return and file VAT and IRAE returns on an annual basis. Among them, there is a subset of companies monitored more exhaustively by the Special Control of Companies unit of the DGI (in more, CEDE companies). The DGI decides which companies will be under the orbit of such unit following private administrative criteria; in general they are usually companies with high levels of turnover and/or inserted in sectors of activity with higher risk of evasion. CEDE companies file additional VAT (monthly) and IRAE (semiannually) returns.

Uruguay's tax authority collected taxes for about 19% of GDP in 2019. VAT represents 46% of the collection and the CIT about 14%. The only estimates of evasion in firms for Uruguay refer to VAT. The tax authority estimates placed the VAT evasion rate in 2012 close to 13% [@direcciongeneralimpositivaEstimacionEvasionImpuesto2019]. This is a low evasion rate for the region: @gomezsabainiTaxStructureTax2012 estimated that the VAT compliance gap in Latin America averaged 25.9% in 2006, ranging from 11.0% in Chile to 38.1% in Nicaragua. In turn, estimated evasion in Uruguay is comparable to estimates for some developed countries. For example, the VAT compliance gap in the European Union was 11% in 2018 with wide variation across countries. The lowest gaps were found in Sweden (0.7%), Croatia (3.5%) and Finland (3.6%), and the highest in Romania (33.8%), Greece (30.1%) and Lithuania (25.9%) [@europeancommissiondgtaxudStudyReportsVAT2020].

## E-invoicing

E-invoicing involves the issuance of digital vouchers documenting a company's business operations. From the tax administration's perspective, the technology allows access to tax information in almost real time, which allows for better collection projections, a better understanding of the dynamics of business activity, and the automation of control and auditing processes. The policy also has benefits for taxpayers, in that it reduces compliance costs and can improve efficiency from reduced operating costs and gains from potential automation and integration processes between companies [@barreixFacturaElectronicaAmerica2018].

Electronic invoicing in Uruguay began to be designed in 2011. After a previous stage of joint planning with companies, the approval of specific regulations, and the implementation of a pilot plan with 30 companies, the first issuers began to operate in 2012. Between 2012 and 2014, significant tax reductions were offered to encourage companies to voluntarily join the system. During this period, large taxpayers, companies subject to special control by the DGI[^cede], and free shop companies are also obliged to join the system. Then, in 2015, a mandatory entry schedule is established linked to the level of sales reported by the companies [@canalesUruguayPerfilFactura2018].

[^cede]: Also known as CEDE, Control Especial de Empresas.

The policy contemplates the issuance of several types of electronic vouchers, documenting transactions between taxpayers (e-invoices) and with end consumers (e-tickets). In turn, there are specific documents for the shipment of goods (e-remittance), tax withholding (e-remittance), and for export operations (e-invoice for export, e-remittance for export). The vouchers contain exhaustive information on each operation, including the corresponding taxes (VAT, IMESI) and withholdings (IRAE, IRPF). The issuing company must send the electronic voucher to the DGI and to the electronic receiver before the transaction is completed. In addition, it must create and send a daily report with consolidated information of all the vouchers issued during the day, broken down by type of voucher and by branch [@direcciongeneralimpositivaFormatoCFE2023; @direcciongeneralimpositivaFormatoReporteDiario2023; @canalesUruguayPerfilFactura2018].

I employ data extracted directly from the electronic invoicing system, which covers the period from the start of e-invoicing until November 2016. In that period, only companies with more than 30 million Indexed Units (hereinafter, IU) of annual invoicing[^context-2]  –and a small group of firms deemed "large taxpayers"– had been mandated to issue electronic vouchers. The remaining firms would be required to issue e-invoices gradually, according to a schedule defined by revenue, which mandated a new cohort of companies to issue e-invoices every six months. @tbl-policy-adoption-schedule in the \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/8dp2z62gf3w5jkf/Online-appendix.pdf?st=lp7mjeeh&dl=0}{Online Appendix} presents said schedule.

[^context-2]: Equivalent at that time to USD 3.3 million in annual billings.

Panel (a) of @fig-adoption shows how such adoption was distributed over time using tax microdata (I describe the data in more detail in [Section @sec-data]). As of November 2016, `3674` firms had begun issuing e-invoices, which corresponds to roughly 6% of the sample. Despite there being a small number of e-invoice issuing firms, their aggregate invoicing volume is very significant. Panel (b) of @fig-adoption shows the share of each year's production that was exchanged using e-invoices; in 2016 it had reached 52% of national output. There are major differences across industries, however –three industries are highlighted in the figure for illustrative purposes–. For instance, while 73% of manufacturing turnover used e-invoices in 2016, only 18% of financial services' turnover did.

Firms that issued e-invoices had high revenues and a relevant position in Uruguayan value chains. This led to a substantial proportion of Uruguayan firms receiving e-invoices soon after the policy was implemented. Panel (c) of @fig-adoption illustrates how already since the beginning of 2014 more than half of the Uruguayan companies had received at least an e-invoice. As will be seen in [Section @sec-results], however, the information generated by the policy on the purchases of the recipient companies was far from complete.
