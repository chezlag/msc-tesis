Cost over-reporting is one of the main forms of VAT evasion [@waseemInformationAsymmetricIncentives2019; @waseemOverclaimedRefundsUndeclared2023; @fanDynamicEffectsComputerizing2023]. Reception of e-invoices creates a database of firms' costs that tax authorities can use to verify tax affidavits and potentially detect instances of cost over-reporting. This was the main effect I anticipated from the policy, but as I detailed in [Section @sec-results], I find no statistically significant effects on firm outcomes. At least two factors that may explain this result.

First, the null effect may be due to the incomplete implementation of the policy during the analysed period. Partial digitisation of intercompany transactions may hinder the tax authority's ability to detect cost inconsistencies. As I discussed in [Section @sec-results-rollout], by the end of the period, for 75% of recipient firms, e-invoices could account for less than 50% of reported costs. In this context, firms could attribute their (overstated) costs to transactions with firms that do not issue e-invoices.

@carrilloDodgingTaxmanFirm2017 highlight an asymmetry in how third-party information can affect tax returns. As a general rule, third-party information operates as a floor for reports on taxable items. When information refers to revenue, it can lead to a reduction in revenue underreporting. However, for costs –unless third-party information provides complete coverage of firm activity– firms may still over-report above the imposed floor, therby reducing tax liability. The result aligns with hypotheses (H1) and (H5) outlined in [Section @sec-hypotheses].

Second, the results may reflect limitations in the selected research design. The sample I used in my estimations consists of a balanced panel of firms in the lowest quintile of revenue, who also file non-simplified tax affidavits. While this sample is small, as noted in [Section @sec-data], larger firms could influence their suppliers’ decisions to adopt e-invoices, potentially compromising the (relative) randomness of when firms began receiving e-invoices.

To account for this possibility, in @sec-appendix-iv I test an alternative approach using an instrumental variables strategy, which allowed me to consider a larger sample. I find that receiving e-invoices reduces reported input VAT, in a statistically significant albeit economically insignificant way. Additionally, I find no effect on output VAT or net VAT liability. Thus, even with an alternative methodology and a different sample, the impact of receiving e-invoices on tax compliance remains minimal.   These findings underscore the role of the policy’s incomplete implementation in the null or muted effects observed.

My last research question referred to potential heterogeneities in the policy's impact by firm size, by share of output destined for household consumption, and by share of imported inputs. In [Section @sec-hypotheses], I hypothesised stronger effects for (H6) smaller firms, (H7) industries with higher shares of final consumption, and (H8) industries with lower reliance on imported inputs. However, I find no statistically significant effects in any subgroup, nor evidence that the coefficients differ significantly across groups. Similarly, I cannot rule out the absence of heterogeneous effects with the instrumental variable strategy. It is worth clarifying, once again, that these results may be due to a lack of power to detect effects, which appear to have a very small magnitude in the analysed period.
