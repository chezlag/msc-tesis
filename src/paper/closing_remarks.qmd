# Closing remarks {#sec-closing-remarks}

In this paper I sought to quantify the effect of receiving e-invoices on the tax compliance of firms in Uruguay in the first years of policy implementation. I applied two difference-in-differences estimation strategies focusing on a sample of small firms and found no statistically significant effect on VAT purchases, VAT sales or VAT due declared by the firms in the sample. On the other hand, I do find a slight effect on the extensive margin: the probability that recipient firms report VAT purchases and VAT sales increases 1-2%. Using an IV strategy, which allowed me to incorporate a larger number of firms into the analysis, I found a slight but statistically significant reduction in VAT purchases reported by firms.

Broadly speaking, the results are consistent with the hypotheses put forward in [Section @sec-hypotheses]. In the period under analysis, the policy would not have generated enough information on recipient firms in order to substantially reduce cost over-reporting. Detecting such a small effect presents a challenge for the data and methods used. On the other hand, the effects that I do find coincide in sign with what was expected.

The absence of effect –or its reduced magnitude– should be understood as a highly local and partial result. The implementation of e-invoicing reached all Uruguayan firms only in 2023, meaning that the evaluation in this study, which extends only until 2015, should be interpreted as a short-term effect. Evidence from evaluations of similar policies in other countries suggest that the effects in the medium and long term may be substantially greater [@bellonDigitalizationImproveTax2022; @fanDynamicEffectsComputerizing2023]. In the Uruguayan case, more recent firm data is needed to assess e-invoicing comprehensively.

There are two specific points that could be interesting to explore in the future.  First, a key limitation of this paper is its inability to examine the effects of receiving e-invoices on the intensive margin of tax returns. Further studies employing different research designs and/or a larger number of observations could overcome this problem.  Second, the effect found on output VAT suggests that receiving e-invoices may influence the reporting of variables unrelated to the information directly provided by the policy. The extent of this effect remains to be explored. In particular, the policy could affect the reporting of other taxes such as the CIT, even though these taxes do not appear directly in the e-invoices. Quantifying the policy's impact on other taxes –both for the receipt and issuance of e-invoices– is a question not yet addressed in the literature.
